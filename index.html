At this temperature, they have even been seen bathing in lakes and rivers. The yak’s warm coat provides insulation through a thick outer coating of long hair and a dense inner coating of matted, shorter fur.">

Just like your bones, a turtle’s shell is actually part of its skeleton. It’s made up of over 50 bones which include the turtle’s rib cage and spine.">
                
            <img class='image' src="./images/thumbnail_images/tiger.jpg" alt="tiger" data-imagebox="gallery" data-imagebox-src="./images/tiger.jpg" data-imagebox-caption="Tigers are the largest wild cats in the world. Adults can weigh up to 363kg (that’s about the same as ten ten year olds!) and measure up to 3.3m! At full speed, tigers can reach up to 65km/h.">
                
            <img class='image' src="./images/thumbnail_images/shark.jpg" alt="shark" data-imagebox="gallery" data-imagebox-src="./images/shark.jpg" data-imagebox-caption="Sharks do not have bones. They are a special type of fish known 'elasmobranch', which translates into fish made of cartilaginous tissues—the clear gristly stuff that your ears and nose tip are made of. Shark skin feels exactly like sandpaper because it is made up of tiny teeth-like structures called placoid scales, also known as dermal denticles. These scales point towards the tail and help reduce friction from surrounding water when the shark swims.">

They have highly sensitive sense of touch and water increases sensitivity even more. By touching the food they get better insight about things they will eat.">

This makes them the perfect pet for working people! Rabbits have good night vision and can see movement from long distances. They can see things to the side, behind or above them without even moving their heads.">

The expression may have come from an incorrect association between Africa and jungles or may refer to a less literal meaning of the word jungle. A lion’s heels don’t touch the ground when it walks.">

While they might look bear-like with their round ears and big black nose, they actually share more characteristics with other marsupials like the wombat.">

They have very long and sharp tail that is usually half of the body size. Tail is used mainly for defense (iguana can punch its enemy with tail). In the case of danger, iguana can detach a part of its tail to ensure fast escape from predator.">

The result? Newborns are welcomed to the world with a 1.5m drop to the ground! Ouch!

Other animals, like birds, sharks, and turtles, have this 'magnetic sense,'' but the fox is the first one we've discovered that uses it to catch prey.">

They’re not Royal White Tigers.  They’re not Snow Tigers. They’re not albinos. They’re simply tigers that are born with white fur. White fur is a very rare genetic mutation. It occurs in the wild possibly in as few as 1 in 10,000 wild tiger births.">
